Based on the main.c file above, create a file named 0-main.c. This file must test that the function positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given a case of 0.

You are not coding the solution / function, you’re just testing it! However, you can adapt your function from 0x01. C - Variables, if, else, while - Task #0 to compile with this main file to test locally.

You only need to upload 0-main.c and main.h for this task. We will provide our own positive_or_negative() function.
You are not allowed to add or remove lines of code, you may change only one line in this task.
#include "main.h"

/**
* main - tests function that prints if integer is positive or negative
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
        int i;

        i = 0;
        positive_or_negative(i);

        return (0);
}
Copy this main file. Comment out (don’t delete it!) the part of the code that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

Don’t add or remove any lines of code, as we will be checking your line count. You are only allowed to comment out existing code.
You do not have to compile with -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic for this task.
#include <stdio.h>

/**
* main - causes an infinite loop
* Return: 0
*/

int main(void)
{
	int i;

	printf("Infinite loop incoming :(\n");

	i = 0;

	/*while (i < 10)*/
	/*{*/
	/*putchar(i);*/
	/*}*/

	printf("Infinite loop avoided! \\o/\n");

	return (0);
}
ix the code in 2-largest_number.c so that it correctly prints out the largest of three numbers, no matter the case.
#include "main.h"

/**
 * largest_number - returns the largest of 3 numbers
 * @a: first integer
 * @b: second integer
 * @c: third integer
 * Return: largest number
 */

int largest_number(int a, int b, int c)
{
	int largest;

	if (a > b && a > c)
	{
		largest = a;
	}
	else if (a > b && c > a)
	{
		largest = c;
	}
	else if (b > c)
	{
		largest = b;
	}
	else
	{
		largest = c;
	}

	return (largest);
}
